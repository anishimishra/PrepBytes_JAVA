/*To solve this problem, we need to get two optimum indexes of arr[]: left index i and right index j. 
For an element arr[i], we do not need to consider arr[i] for left index if there is an element smaller than 
arr[i] on left side of arr[i]. Similarly, if there is a greater element on right side of arr[j] then we do not 
need to consider this j for right index. So we construct two auxiliary arrays LMin[] and RMax[] such that LMin[i] 
holds the smallest element on left side of arr[i] including arr[i], and RMax[j] holds the greatest element on 
right side of arr[j] including arr[j]. After constructing these two auxiliary arrays, we traverse both of these 
arrays from left to right. While traversing LMin[] and RMa[] if we see that LMin[i] is greater than RMax[j], then
we must move ahead in LMin[] (or do i++) because all elements on left of LMin[i] are greater than or equal to 
LMin[i]. Otherwise we must move ahead in RMax[j] to look for a greater j â€“ i value.*/

/*The problem can be solved by simply finding out two Optimum Indexes of the array, left index i and right 
     index j.
For an element A[i], we need not consider it for the left index if there exists a smaller element than A[i] 
      on its left side.
Similarly for an element A[i], we need not consider it for the right index if there exits a greater element 
     on its right side.
Now construct two arrays : leftMin[] and rightMax[],
  such that leftMin[i] contains the smallest element on its left side including itself and 
  rightMax[i] contains the largest element on its right side including itself.
Start traversing both the arrays from left to right.
While traversing :-
        if leftMin[i] > rightMax[i], then we simply move ahead in leftMin[] by 1, as all elements to the left of leftMin[i] are either greater than or equal to leftMin[i]
        if leftMin[i] < rightMax[i], then we move ahead in rightMax[i] to look for a better value of j-i. */
